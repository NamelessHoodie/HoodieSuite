# ?ToolName?
 A user friendly modding suite for from software games

# RoadMap:
- [x] 1: Fancy Looking GUI.

- [x] 2: Automatic tool manager so no manual downloads are required.

- [x] 3: Ability to launch said tools from inside the program.

- [ ] 4: Supporting multiple types of tool "extensions", download loose binaries, bundled binaries, integrated tool.

- [ ] 5: Ability to unpack the game with uxm if your game is not already unpacked

- [ ] 6: Integrated File explorer, using a definition file to display in a virtual file system, where names, icons and path can differ from their original entry.

- [ ] 7:  When a file is double clicked in the integrated explorer ,ability to launch other tools opening a file directly.

- [ ] 8: If something is opened from the integrated explorer, and it isn't present in your mod folder. It should automatically be copied there.

- [ ] 9: from software archive types should be browsed and edited just like folders.

- [ ] 10: Every file needs to have an handler, write subtools to handle every file that hasn't been handled.
